       "76  Lawrence Berkeley National Lab’s (LBNL) Joint Genome Institute (JGI) Division has an opening for an experienced Data Scientist to join the User Support Analysis group.\\n\\nThe User Support Analysis (USA) group performs custom analyses for research projects across the JGI. These include diverse experiment types (including resequencing, transcriptomics, epigenomics, single cell transcriptomics, nanopore sequencing, metabolomics, CRIPSR screens), and subject areas (plant, fungal, microbial and environmental genomics projects). Our group contributes to hundreds of projects from JGI’s user programs each year, and also provides substantial input on internal proof of principle projects using new technologies. Some recent examples include: population genomics in poplar (Nature genetics 46 (10), 1089-1096), functional genomics in bacteria (Nature 557 (7706), 503-509), single-cell transcriptomics in plants (Cell reports 27 (7), 2241-2247. e4).   \n",
